# Dev Test 1

## Scenario
You have taken up maintenance on an application created by another developer.  
This application has a function that generates a CSV report based on a list of customers.  
The users are complaining that the CSV report takes 10 seconds or more to generate.  
They would like report to generate in 2 seconds or less.

## Your Task.
In your pull request
* Describe in detail the reason that the CSV report is generating slowly.
  * Hint, it's not just because of the 100,000 iteration loop.
* Optimize the code to generate the report in under 2 seconds.

## Constraints
* Do not change the Customers class.
* Do not use any additional libraries (no additional nuget packages).
